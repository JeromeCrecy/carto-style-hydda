tilemill-style-hydda
====================

Hydda, a carto style project used by OpenStreetMap Sweden.
https://openstreetmap.se/#4/63.94/18.68

Based on an old version of OSMBright
https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright
but patched to add more features such as piers, stadiums, pitches, and more. 

Also tweaked for better rendering of archipelagos, as many styles have a problem with rendering names in such areas.

Colors are originally selected for working well with transparent red-yellow-green heat map overlays.

Using Google Noto fonts (a fork of the OSM Carto font setup) rather than Open Sans as original in OSM Bright.
