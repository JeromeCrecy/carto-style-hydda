tilemill-style-hydda
====================

Hydda style TileMill project

The style is hosted at OpenStreetMap Sweden.
https://openstreetmap.se/#4/63.94/18.68

Based on an old version of OSMBright, but patched to add more features such as piers, stadiums, pitches, and more. 

Also tweaked for better rendering of archipelagos, as many styles have a problem with rendering names in such areas. https://openstreetmap.se/#14/58.5988/11.2150 compared to https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/58.5987/11.2040

Colors are selected for working well with transparent red-yellow-green heatmap overlays.
